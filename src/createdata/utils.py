# Re-use a single ``requests`` session so we get connection pooling and can also
# configure retries in one place.  Some of the UFC endpoints occasionally return
# transient ``403``/``5xx`` responses or redirect to the HTTPS version of the
# site.  The previous implementation made a bare ``requests.get`` call without
# any headers and with redirects disabled which resulted in downloading the
# intermediate/forbidden page.  Parsing those pages produced empty or garbled
# data (missing fighter names, stats, etc.).


# ``Session`` gives us a convenient place to set a User-Agent header that more
# closely resembles a real browser and to enable automatic redirects.  This
# dramatically increases the success rate of requests to ``ufcstats.com``.
